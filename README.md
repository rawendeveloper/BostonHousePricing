## 🌟 Overview

In this project, I used  the Boston housing dataset to build a predictive model for house prices. The entire workflow will cover data preparation, model training, and deployment using Flask and Railway

## 🛠️ Tools and Software Required

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- Docker
- Git
- Railway

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/boston-house-pricing.git>
    cd boston-house-pricing
    
    ```
    
2. **Create a new environment** (optional but recommended):
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copier le code
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    
    ```
    
3. **Install the required packages**:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copier le code
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    ```

## 🌍 Deployment

This project can be deployed using **Railway** or **Docker**.

### 🚄 Railway Deployment

1. **Sign Up / Log In**: Go to [Railway](https://railway.app/) and create an account or log in.
2. **Create New Project**: Click "New Project" and select "Deploy from GitHub."
3. **Connect Repository**: Authorize Railway to access your GitHub and select your repository.
4. **Add Environment Variables** (if needed) in the project settings.
5. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy" to build and launch your application.
6. **Access Application**: Use the provided URL to view your app.

### 🐳 Docker Deployment

1. **Install Docker**: Follow instructions on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. **Create a Dockerfile**: Ensure your project has a `Dockerfile` similar to below:

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM python:3.x
   WORKDIR /app   COPY requirements.txt .
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   COPY . .
   EXPOSE 5000
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]  # Update to your main file

```

1. **Build the Image**:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copier le code
    docker build -t boston-house-pricing .
    
    ```
    
2. **Run the Container**:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copier le code
    docker run -p 5000:5000 boston-house-pricing
    
    ```
    
3. **Access Application**: Visit `http://localhost:5000` to view your app.

Now your application is deployed on Railway or running locally with Docker! 🚀
